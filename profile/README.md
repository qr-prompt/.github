QR-Prompt is an open initiative to create and maintain an open standard for embedding AI prompts inside QR codes.

Our mission is to make it easy and safe to transfer tasks, instructions, and interactions from the physical world (e.g. posters, manuals, packaging, robots) directly into AI systems (like ChatGPT, Grok, or open-source models).

🌍 What we do

Develop and publish the AIPROMPT specification (YAML/JSON format with AIPROMPT: prefix).

Provide schemas, examples, and reference parsers in multiple languages.

Advocate for native support of AIPROMPT: and qrprompt:// links in AI applications and APIs.

Ensure the standard remains open, vendor-neutral, and community-driven.

🔒 Values

Open — licensed under Apache 2.0, free for anyone to use or implement.

Interoperable — works across different AI models, apps, and ecosystems.

Safe — built with privacy and user consent in mind.

Practical — easy to generate, scan, and integrate.

✨ Vision

We believe AI interactions should be as easy as scanning a QR code — whether for learning, robotics, accessibility, or everyday tasks.
